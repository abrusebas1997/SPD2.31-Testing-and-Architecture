1. Based on our first implementation `weather_data1.py`, which of the following apply? (Choose all that apply.)  
    [ ] A. We are coding to concrete implementations, not interfaces.  
    [ ] B. For every new display we’ll need to alter this code.  
    [ ] C. We have no way to add (or remove) display elements at runtime.  
    [ ] D. The display elements don’t implement a common interface.  
    [ ] E. We haven’t encapsulated the part that changes.  
    [ ] F. We are violating encapsulation of the WeatherData class.
